--- /views
-- /python
- /src

-- /controllers
-- /core
-- /models
- /templates

## How it's works

Files at the firt level don't have to be modified.
Fils from dav's lib don't have to be modified too.

`index.php` call `/public/index.php`, where things begin.

`<?php
//we put the gets in a ses, joinable by `get()`
$g=gets();

//the defaut `$a` is set at `home`.
//that mean the first operation will be with `home`
get('a','home');//default app

//so we have modified `$g`
$g=ses::gets();

//here we init the software, with global parameters
boot::call();

//here we build the css from the json `styles`
//and it will be named like that
//following some global parameters
css::build('styles');

//here we prepare `::head` with vars from the json `headers`
head::json('cnfg/headers');

//we add a jscode, to inform the current state of the navigator
head::add('jscode','state='.json_encode($g).';');

//here we display the headers
echo head::run();

//now is the software
//module is the basic thing called in every circumstances
$ret=module::call();

//we maybe will have to use some popups
$ret.=tag('div',['class'=>'popup'],"").n();

//display the errors and notifications during the execution
if(ses('dev'))echo div(rdiv(ses::$er),'small').n();

//display the final result
echo tagb('body',$ret);

//not useful
//echo '</html>';`
