# simple and fast php project using dav's library

This package let create a simple website for publication of articles with comments.
It do not use any depandancie.
The Framework abilities are located in the dav's lib.
The doc of the framework is in the folder /dav.

## Introduction

This is an exercice for a little cms based of the library of dav.

It must display articles, list of articles, a contact, a login, and some attempted features for a personal website.

## Resolution of urls

From the root, the index only serve to resolve all the urls.
Two fils are in the root :
- index.php
- ajax.php

## Structure of the directories

- /dav
- /img
- /public
-- /css
-- /js
-- /json
--- /cnfg
--- /lang
--- /views
-- /python
- /src
-- /app
-- /controllers
-- /core
-- /models
- /templates

## How it's works

Files at the firt level don't have to be modified.
Fils from dav's lib don't have to be modified too.

`index.php` call `/public/index.php`, where things begin.

    //we put the gets in a ses, joinable by `get()`
    $g=gets();

    //the defaut `$a` is set at `home`.
    //that mean the first operation will be with `home`
    get('a','home');//default app

    //so we have modified `$g`
    $g=ses::gets();

    //here we init the software, with global parameters
    boot::call();

    //here we build the css from the json `styles`
    //and it will be named like that
    //following some global parameters
    css::build('styles');

    //here we prepare `::head` with vars from the json `headers`
    head::json('cnfg/headers');

    //we add a jscode, to inform the current state of the navigator
    head::add('jscode','state='.json_encode($g).';');

    //here we display the headers
    echo head::run();

    //now is the software
    //module is the basic thing called in every circumstances
    $ret=module::call();

    //we maybe will have to use some popups
    $ret.=tag('div',['class'=>'popup'],"").n();

    //display the errors and notifications during the execution
    if(ses('dev'))echo div(rdiv(ses::$er),'small').n();

    //display the final result
    echo tagb('body',$ret);

    //not useful
    //echo '</html>';

### The path of the information

The `module` is strictly restricted to build the index and give the four variables it needs.

The `blocks` contains basic fnctions that not need to be in a separated file.
The `call()` of the `blocks` let root the request between :
- present functions in `blocks`
- specific classes
- a root to specific classes not necessary named like how we call them (like *home*).

The information continue, for example to the `posts`.
Here, some constructors (it's a *controller*) assume to bring values to the templater.

Coming from `ajax.php`, the path on the information is the same.
`ajax.js` is exclusively restricted to call `blocks` and send the result in the variable `content` of the main `index.php`.

Every functions of the software are following this path.

## Caracterstics

- All the verbose of the software is externalized.
- The treatment is sparated between the constructors (models and controllers) and the display (views).
